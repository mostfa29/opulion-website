AI Transaction Command Center: Frontend Architecture & User Experience
1. Guiding Principles & Design Philosophy
The frontend will be built with one person in mind: a busy real estate agent who is not tech-savvy. Every design and architectural decision serves the goal of making their life simpler, not more complicated.

Clarity Over Clutter: The interface will be minimalist. We will show only what is necessary for the current task, avoiding distracting menus, icons, or features.

One-Click Confidence: Key actions should feel powerful yet simple. The "magic moment" of creating a transaction must be intuitive and require minimal input.

Guided Workflow: The application will guide the agent naturally from one step to the next. They should never feel lost or wonder what to do next.

Mobile-First Responsive Design: Agents are often on the go. The application will be fully functional and easy to use on a phone, tablet, or desktop.

2. The User Flow: An Agent's Journey
This is the step-by-step path an agent will take through the MVP.

Login & First View (The Main Dashboard):

The agent logs in and lands on the Main Dashboard.

This screen is a clean, high-level overview of all their active deals.

Each deal is represented by a simple "card" showing the most critical info: Property Address, Client Name, and the Next Upcoming Deadline.

The most prominent button on this screen is "Add New Deal".

Creating a New Deal (The "Magic Moment"):

The agent clicks "Add New Deal".

A simple pop-up window (New Deal Modal) appears. It has only four fields:

Client Name

Client Email

Property Address

Sale Price

A large, clear button says "Upload Signed Contract (PDF)".

After uploading the PDF, the final button, "Create Transaction", becomes active.

AI Processing (The 30-Second Wait):

Upon clicking "Create Transaction," the modal closes, and the screen shows a simple, reassuring loading animation.

Text on the screen says: "Our AI is analyzing your contract and building your command center. This will take about 30 seconds..." This manages expectations and reinforces the value of the AI.

The Deal Dashboard (The Command Center):

After processing, the agent is automatically taken to the Deal Dashboard for the new transaction. This is the command center for a single deal.

The agent does not have to search for it; the app takes them there directly. This is a crucial part of the seamless experience.

From here, they can see all the extracted information and manage the transaction.

Returning and Managing:

When the agent logs in next time, they will see their new deal on the Main Dashboard. Clicking on its card will take them directly to that specific Deal Dashboard.

3. UI Component Breakdown
This section details the key screens and components of the application.

A. The Main Dashboard (DashboardView)
Purpose: To provide a quick, at-a-glance overview of all ongoing transactions.

Key UI Elements:

Header: Displays the App Name and a clear "Add New Deal" button with a + icon.

Deal List: A list of DealCard components.

DealCard Component: Each card is a self-contained summary of one deal.

Property Address (Large, bold text)

Client Name

Next Critical Date: Shows only the next upcoming deadline (e.g., "Inspection Due: Sept 15, 2024"). This creates a sense of urgency and focus.

Status Badge: A colored tag (e.g., "Active", "Pending", "Closed").

B. The New Deal Modal (NewDealModal)
Purpose: To capture the initial information and contract with zero friction.

Key UI Elements:

Simple Form: Clean, well-spaced input fields for the four required pieces of information.

File Uploader: A large, inviting area to drag-and-drop or click to upload the PDF. It will show the filename once a file is selected.

Primary Action Button: The "Create Transaction" button is disabled until the form is filled and a file is uploaded, guiding the user to complete the required steps.

C. The Deal Dashboard (DealDashboardView)
Purpose: This is the agent's command center for a single deal. It presents all the AI-extracted information in a clear, actionable format.

Key UI Elements:

Header:

A "Back to Dashboard" arrow icon/link.

The Property Address and Client Name are displayed prominently as the page title.

Critical Dates Component:

This is the most important part of the page. It's a chronological list of all deadlines extracted by the AI.

Each row contains:

[ ] A Checkbox for the agent to manually "Mark as Complete".

Deadline Name (e.g., "Loan Application").

Due Date (e.g., "September 20, 2024").

Key Information Panel: A simple section with two sub-components:

Key Contacts: A list showing the client's name and email.

Financials: Displays the Sale Price and Earnest Money amount.

Documents Panel:

A single, prominent button/link that says "Open Google Drive Folder". This provides direct access to the automatically created workspace.

4. State Management & API Interaction (Simplified)
State Management: We will use React's built-in tools (useState, useContext) to manage the application's data. Think of this as the app's short-term memory. It will hold the list of deals, the details of the currently selected deal, and whether the "New Deal" pop-up is open. This approach is simple and avoids unnecessary complexity for the MVP.

API Interaction:

On "Create Transaction" click: The frontend sends the uploaded PDF and form data to our backend.

Backend Work: The backend sends the PDF to the Google Gemini API for analysis and uses the Google Drive API to create the folder structure.

Data Return: The backend returns all the extracted dates, contact info, and the link to the new Google Drive folder.

UI Update: The frontend receives this data and uses it to populate the Deal Dashboard before redirecting the user. The agent experiences this as a seamless transition from the loading screen to a fully built-out command center.

This architecture directly supports the MVP's core principle: to attack the post-signature chaos by transforming a manual, multi-hour process into a simple, 30-second, AI-driven action.
